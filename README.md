## Overview:

Welcome to the Cricket Match Simulation Project! This project offers a realistic and engaging simulation of a cricket match, allowing you to:

Select teams and players <br>
Simulate innings with realistic batting and bowling actions <br>
Track scores, wickets, and other statistics <br>
Customize match duration and rules <br>
Experiment with different strategies <br>
Whether you're a cricket enthusiast or simply enjoy sports simulations, this project provides a fun and interactive way to experience the thrill of the game. <br>

## Requirements:

Python 3.x <br>
Openpyxl library (for loading player data from Excel) <br>
## Recommended Modules: (Optional)

NumPy (for statistical calculations)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
## Installation:

Ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed.

Clone this repository or download the zip file.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

## Install required dependencies:

### Bash:
 > pip install openpyxl
 
 > pip install numpy matplotlib

## Usage:

Run the main script cricket_match_simulation.py to initiate the project. You'll be guided through interactive choices:

Select teams and players from a predefined list. <br>
Configure match settings like number of overs, toss winner, and batting order. <br>
Witness the simulated match unfold, with commentary and updates on runs, wickets, and overs. <br>
View final scores, player statistics, and match summary. <br>
You can modify the script or configuration files to explore different scenarios and customize your experience. <br>

## Game Simulation:

The simulation engine models batting and bowling actions based on player attributes and random chance. <br>
Runs are scored, wickets are taken, and overs progress realistically. <br>
Commentary enhances the gameplay experience. <br>
## Scoring & Statistics:

Scores are tracked for each team and individual players. <br>
Wickets, runs, overs, and strike rates are calculated accurately. <br>
You can access detailed player and team statistics after the match. <br>
## Troubleshooting:

Ensure you have met all system requirements. <br>
Check for errors in the console output. <br>
Refer to the documentation or seek help from the community if needed. <br>
